# Python Introduction

## Basic control flow

In this exercise, we will focus on the usage of the basic control flow operations, including:  
 - if-else statements,
 - for and while loops, 
 - input from the user,
 - comparison operators,
 - assignment operators,
 - logical operators.

## Tasks

### 

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 1 - basic math operations

Your task is to write a program which asks the user three times for a number. If number is even print ‘Even number’, else print ‘Odd number’.

>Hint: you can use `for` or `while` loop to perform the same operation more than once!

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter number: 123
Odd number
Enter number: 32
Even number
Enter number: 121234
Even number
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 2 - Calculate the sum of the numbers

Your task is to write a program which asks the user three times for a number and prints the sum of those numbers.

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter number: 200
Enter number: 500
Enter number: 300
Sum of the numbers: 1000
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 3 - Find the maximum number

Your task is to write a program which asks the user five times for a number and prints the maximum of those numbers.

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter number: 50
Enter number: 680
Enter number: 7
Enter number: 1030
Enter number: -4 
Maximum of the numbers: 1030
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 4 - finding divisors of a number

Your task is to write a program which prints all the divisors of a number. 
The number comes from the user's input.

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter number: 56
2
4
7
8
14
28
56
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 5 - Check if a number is even and divisible by 3

Your task is to write a program which asks the user for a number and prints if it is even and divisible by 3.

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter a number: 6
6 is even and divisible by 3
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 6 - Check if a number is positive, odd and divisible by 7

Your task is to write a program which asks the user for a number and prints if a number is positive, odd and divisible by 7

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter a number: 21
21 is positive, odd and divisible by 7
```
